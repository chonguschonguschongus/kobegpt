## Description

This project is a simple AI-powered chatbot that I used to learn Python as a beginner. Instead of wasting time searching for the best introduction course or paying money for it even, I leveraged the power of OpenAI API and some prompt engineering techniques to get AI to coach me in Python in an engaging manner. As a fan of the NBA and Kobe Bryant, it made learning the language even more acccessible to me.
